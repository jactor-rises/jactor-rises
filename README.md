### What is this repository for? ###

* Src code for jactor-rises

This project is created as microsevices and not as a monolithic client/server applications.

The only hard dependencies between jactor modules are:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.facade;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.model;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.persistence.orm;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.web;
    jactor.rises.model-->jactor.rises.facade;
```

### Set up ###

* spring-boot applications are created when building (`mvn install`)
    * `jactor-persistence-orm` is a standalone rest application which handles the persistence on a database using an object relational model and `spring-data-jpa`
    * `jactor-facade` is a rest applications which handles io from any interaction with/from `jactor-model`
    * `jactor-web` is a web application on apache tomcat
* these applications can run side by side to get a full working web-application (using `mvn spring-boot:run` on each application)
* `jactor-persistence-orm` is using h2 (in-memory database), and is not finite
* after started `jactor-web`, point a browser to http://localhost:8080/jactor-web/

### Disclaimer ###

These applications are not 100% finished, but created for my own learning. That is to say:

* `Blog`s are only persisted in `jactor-persistence-orm` and only have an integration test of the rest api that verifies actual interactions.
* `GuestBook`s have interactions from `jactor-model` and are tested with an integration test, but lack interactions from `jactor-web`.
* `User` (with `Person` and `Address`) is fully integrated with communications from `jactor-web`, which use `jactor-model` and `jactor-persistence-orm` (through `jactor-facade`).
  * Note! Not all services for a `User` on `jactor-persistence-orm` is used.
* Persistence in `jactor-persistence-orm` is not satisfactory. There is therefore [an issue](https://github.com/jactor-rises/jactor-rises/issues/1) (help wanted) created for solving a potential "buggy" solution.
* `jactor.rises.facade` is the only module (and microservice) without any `module-info.java`. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/jactor-rises/jactor-rises/issues/2) (help wanted).

### Architecture Summary ###

There are three microservices in this architecture which all handles all of the technical infrastructure needed for performing the business logic of the model:

* `jactor-web` handles all user interaction
* `jactor-persistence-orm` handles persistence of the data
* `jactor-facade` handles all communication between `jactor-model` and the other microservices
  * this microservice has the actual business logic (`jactor-model`) and this a hard dependency to the service. This single jar-file is therefore free of code regarding infrastructure and can solely focus on the business rules to handle.

### Why ###

This is my "sandbox" which I use to learn various aspects of java programming. This repository contains code that is evolved from about the year 2004, going through version control systems as CSV, Subversion, and now Git...
